Brain Tumor Detection and Localization using ResNet50 and ResUNet (Transfer Learning)
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting and localizing brain tumors from MRI scans.

The aim is to:

Reduce the cost of cancer diagnosis

Enable early detection and treatment of brain tumors

Provide a scalable AI-assisted solution for healthcare

We leverage classification + segmentation models:

ResNet Classifier â€“ detects whether an MRI contains a tumor.

ResU-Net Segmentation Model â€“ localizes the tumor at the pixel level if present.

ðŸ§  Why AI in Healthcare?

Early detection of diseases like cancer saves lives.

AI models can process thousands of images faster than human experts.

Deep learning enables pixel-level image understanding, useful in tumor localization.

Integrating AI reduces workload on radiologists while increasing accuracy.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

3,900 Brain MRI scans provided.

Each MRI has an associated mask image that highlights tumor location.

Dataset is imbalanced:

~65% healthy (no tumor)

~35% tumor present

Example:

MRI Image: Patient brain scan

Mask Image: Shows tumor pixels (if present)

ðŸ”§ Project Workflow

Data Exploration & Visualization

Load MRI scans + masks

Analyze class distribution

Visualize healthy vs tumor samples

Stage 1 â€“ Classification

Train a ResNet deep learning classifier

Predict whether a tumor is present

Stage 2 â€“ Segmentation

If tumor detected, apply ResU-Net segmentation

Pixel-level tumor localization

Model Outputs

Tumor probability (classification)

Tumor mask overlay (segmentation)
